## [4.0.0] - 2018-12-10
### Added
- New playground for better debuggability

- Speech synthesis: Support `pause` and `resume` (with `pause` and `resume` event)

### Changed

   - A new set of ponyfill will be created every time an option has changed

### Fixed
- Fix [#13](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/issues/13) Speech recognition: `SpeechRecognitionResult` should be iterable

## [3.0.0] - 2018-10-31
### Added
- Speech Synthesis: Will async fetch speech token instead of throwing exception

### Changed
- Use `@babel/runtime` and `@babel/plugin-tranform-runtime`, in favor of `babel-polyfill`
- Better error handling on `null` token
- Updated voice list from [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/supported-languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/supported-languages)
- Reliability around cancelling a playing utterance
   - Instead of shutting down the `AudioContext`, we will stop the `AudioBufferSourceNode` for a graceful stop
- Simplify speech token authorization
   - `recognition.fetchToken = async () => return await 'your subscription key';`
   - `recognition.fetchToken = createFetchTokenUsingSubscriptionKey('your subscription key');`
   - `fetchToken` will be called every time a token is required, implementor should cache the token as needed
