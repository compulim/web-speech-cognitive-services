## [6.0.0] - 2019-12-03

### Breaking changes

#### Unifying options to pass credentials

`authorizationToken`, `region`, and `subscriptionKey` are being deprecated in favor of `credentials` options. `credentials` can be one of the following types:

- `{ authorizationToken: string, region: string? }`
- `{ region: string?, subscriptionKey: string }`
- `Promise<{ authorizationToken: string, region: string? }>`
- `Promise<{ region: string?, subscriptionKey: string }>`
- `() => { authorizationToken: string, region: string? }`
- `() => { region: string?, subscriptionKey: string }`
- `() => Promise<{ authorizationToken: string, region: string? }>`
- `() => Promise<{ region: string?, subscriptionKey: string }>`

If `credentials` is a function, it will be called just before the credentials is needed and may be called very frequently. This behavior matches the deprecating `authorizationToken`. The result of the call is also expected to be cached.

If `region` is not returned, the default value of `"westus"` will be used.

### Fixed

- Speech recognition: Removed extraneous finalized `result` event in continuous mode, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim), in PR [#79](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pull/79)

### Removed

- 🔥 `authorizationToken`, `region`, and `subscriptionKey` are being deprecated in favor of `credentials` options, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim) in PR [#80](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pull/80)

### Added

- `playground`: Add delayed start to playground for testing speech recognition initiated outside of user gestures, in PR [#78](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-congitive-services/pull/78)
- Speech recognition: New `looseEvents` option, default is `false`. When enabled, we will no longer follow observed browser event order. We will send finalized `result` event as early as possible. This will not break conformance to W3C specifications. By [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim), in PR [#79](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pull/79)
- Speech recognition: Create ponyfill using `SpeechRecognizer` object from [`microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk`](https://npmjs.com/package/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk), by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim), in PR [#73](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pull/73)
- `credentials` option is added for obtaining authorization token and region, or subscription key and region, in a single object or function call, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim) in PR [#80](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pull/80)
- Speech recognition: Polyfill will have `abort`/`stop` function set to `undefined` if the underlying recognizer from Cognitive Services SDK does not support stop/abort, in PR [#81](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pull/81)

### Changed

- Bumped dependencies, in PR [#73](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pull/73)

## [5.0.1] - 2019-10-25

### Changed

- Fixed dependences in PR [#76](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pull/76)
   - `bundle` package
      - `dependencies`: Moved `eslint` to development dependencies
   - `component` package
      - `peerDependencies`: No longer requires `react`
      - `dependencies`
         - Moved `eslint` to development dependencies
         - Removed `event-target-shim` because incompatibility with ES5
      - `devDependencies`: Removed `react`
   - Removed `import '@babel/runtime'` explicitly

## [5.0.0] - 2019-10-23

### Breaking changes

- Instead of stopping `AudioContext` after all pending utterances are finished, the `AudioContext` is now persisted. If this is not desirable in your application and would like to control the lifetime of `AudioContext` object, please create your own instance and pass it as an option named `audioContext` when creating the ponyfill
- `createSpeechServicesPonyfill` function is no longer asynchronous
   - Immediate after the ponyfill is created, we will fetch voice list from the services and emit `voiceschanged` event on completion

- Fix [#55](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/issues/55) and [#63](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/issues/63). Moves to [WHATWG `EventTarget` interface](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-eventtarget), in PR [#56](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pulls/56) and PR [#64](https://github.com/compulim/web-speech-cognitive-services/pulls/64)
