The district was once called Yau Ma Tei District. It was renamed Yau Tsim District from 1 April 1988 to "remove any misconception that Tsim Sha Tsui was an administrative district separate from Yau Ma Tei".

Yau Tsim District and Mong Kok District were merged in 1994 to form the new Yau Tsim Mong District.
