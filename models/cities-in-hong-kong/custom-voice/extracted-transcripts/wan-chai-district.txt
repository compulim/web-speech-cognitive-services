The area colloquially known as Wan Chai is often referred to the area surrounding Tonnochy Road and the Wan Chai Station of the MTR, which is located between Admiralty on the west and Causeway Bay on the east. Wan Chai North, where major buildings such as the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and Central Plaza are located, refers to the area north of Gloucester Road, reclaimed from the sea after the 1970s.
