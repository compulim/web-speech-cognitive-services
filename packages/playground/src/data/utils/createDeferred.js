// This piece of code is adopted from https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-defer

// The reason why we need to fork it is because:
// - The original package published to NPM is not ES5-compliant
//    - Due to the use of arrow functions
// - create-react-app@1 does not play nice with packages that are not ES5-compliant
//    - create-react-app@2 do play nice, but it was so new that most of the people are still on @1

// Criteria to remove this package:
// - When create-react-app@2 become mainstream
